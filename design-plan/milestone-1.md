# Project 3, Milestone 1: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Project
> Which project will you add interactivity to enhance the site's functionality?

Project 2


## Audience's Goals
> List the audience's goals that you identified in Project 1 or 2.
> Simply list each goal. No need to include the "Design Ideas and Choices", etc.
> You may adjust the goals if necessary.

- Discover the festival's event schedule
- Find practical information like parking and accessibility
- Learn about festival history and traditions.


## Modal Interactivity Brainstorm
> Using the audience goals you identified, brainstorm possible options for **modal** interactivity to enhance the functionality of the site while also assisting the audience with their goals.
> Briefly explain each idea and provide a brief rationale for how the interactivity enhances the site's functionality for the audience. (1 sentence)
> Note: You may find it easier to sketch for brainstorming. That's fine too. Do whatever you need to do to explore your ideas.

- Clicking on the map makes the map larger and the background will be fuzzy.
- A event details button opens a modal with key info about festival dates and location
- Modal that opens as soon users click on vendors, prompting a warning a warning that not all things might be available during the time of visit.


## Interactivity Design Ideation
> Explore the possible design solutions for the interactivity.
> Sketch at least two iterations of the modal and at least two iterations of the hamburger menu interactivity.
> Annotate each sketch explaining what happens when a user takes an action. (e.g. When user clicks this, something else appears.)
> Do not include HTML/CSS annotations in your sketches!

## Final Interactivity Design Sketches
> Create _polished_ design sketch(es) (it's still a sketch, but with a little more care taken to communicate ideas clearly to the graders) to plan your interactivity.
> **Sketch out the entire page where your interactivity will go.**
> Include your interactivity to the sketch(es).
> Add annotations to explain what happens when the user takes an action.
> Include as many sketches as necessary to communicate your design (ask yourself, could another 1300 take these sketches an implement my design?)

## Interactivity Rationale
> Describe the purpose of your proposed interactivity.
> Provide a brief rationale explaining how your proposed interactivity addresses the goals of your site's audience.
> This should be about a paragraph. (2-3 sentences)

The interactivity is designed to enhance user experience by providing clear, accessible information about vendor availability and a streamlined navigation experience. The modal disclaimer, displayed when users click on a vendor, ensures visitors understand that vendor presence may vary, helping to manage expectations. The simple hamburger menu supports easy navigation on smaller screens, providing users with quick access to essential festival sections without overwhelming the page.


## Interactivity Planning Sketches
> Produce planning sketches that include all the details another 1300 student would need to implement your interactivity design.
> Your planning sketches should include _all_ HTML elements needed for the interactivity; _annotations_ for the element types, their unique IDs, and CSS classes; and lastly the initial CSS classes.
> This is asking you to create a planning sketch like the one we did during the in-class activity.

## Interactivity Pseudocode Plan
> Write your interactivity pseudocode plan here.
> Pseudocode is not JavaScript. Do not put JavaScript code here.

**Modal pseudocode:**

> Pseudocode to open the modal:

```
when #vendor-Button is clicked:
  remove .hidden from #Disclaimer-modal
```

> Pseudocode to close the modal:

```
when #closeButton is clicked:
  add .hidden to #Discalimer-modal
```

**Hamburger menu pseudocode:**

> Pseudocode to show/hide (toggle) the navigation menu (narrow screens) when the hamburger button is clicked:

```
when the hamburger button is clicked:
  if the navigation menu is not visible:
    remove .hidden from #nav-div
  else:
    add .hidden to #nav-div
```

> Media queries are prohibited to show/hide the hamburger menu for this assignment.
> (I want you to demonstrate the interactivity learning objectives we covered in class.)
> If the browser window is narrow when the page loads, the hamburger button should be visible and the navigation should be hidden.
> If the browser window is wide when the page loads, the hamburger menu should not be visible.
> Complete the pseudocode to show/hide (toggle) the navigation on page load:

```
on page load (ready):
  if window is narrow:
    show hamburger button, hide navigation menu
   else if window is wide:
     hide hamburger button, show navigation menu
```

> If the browser window is resized from wide to narrow, the hamburger menu should become visible and the navigation should be hidden.
> If the browser window is resized from narrow to wide, the hamburger menu should become hidden and the navigation should be visible.

```
on window resize:
  if window is narrow:
    show hamburger button, hide navigation menu
  else if window is wide:
    hide hamburger button, show navigation menu
```
