# Project 3, Final Submission: Design Journey

[← Table of Contents](design-journey.md)


> **Replace ALL _TODOs_ with your work.** (There should be no TODOs in the final submission.)
>
> Be clear and concise in your writing. Bullets points are encouraged.
>
> Place all design journey images inside the "design-plan" folder and then link them in Markdown so that they are visible in Markdown Preview.
>
> **Everything, including images, must be visible in _Markdown: Open Preview_.** If it's not visible in the Markdown preview, then we can't grade it. We also can't give you partial credit either. **Please make sure your design journey should is easy to read for the grader;** in Markdown preview the question _and_ answer should have a blank line between them.


## Milestone 1 Feedback Revisions
> Explain what you revised in response to the Milestone 1 feedback (1-2 sentences)
> If you didn't make any revisions, explain why.

I revised my modal design based on the feedback regarding its usability. Originally, the modal’s positioning interfered with other elements on the page, making it less practical. Now, I’ve placed the button just below the navigation bar for easier access and visibility without obstructing other components.


## Interactivity Usability Justification
> Explain how the interactivity _functionally_ improves the user's experience and helps them accomplish their goals. (i.e. Your interactivity does _more_ than add additional clicks; the interactivity doesn't insert additional barriers for the user when working towards their goals.)
> Explain how your interactivity's design effectively uses affordances, visibility, feedback, and familiarity.
> Write a paragraph (3-4 sentences)

The interactivity enhances user experience by providing immediate, intuitive access to essential actions without unnecessary steps. The use of visible buttons and clear icons improves affordances, signaling what can be clicked or interacted with. Feedback is provided through animations and color changes, making the interface feel responsive and dynamic. Familiarity is prioritized by adhering to common design patterns, ensuring users can intuitively navigate without a learning curve, thereby making the interaction smooth and accessible.


## Tell Us What to Grade
> We aren't re-grading your entire Project 1 or 2.
> We are only grading the interactivity you added to the project.
> Tell us where (what pages) we can find your interactivity and how to use it.
> **We will only grade what you list here;** if it's not listed here, we won't grade it. **No exceptions.**

The modal after clicking on the grey disclaimer button on every page and the hamburger button on every page that when it's clicked it shows up the navigation menu in a narrow screen.


## Self-Reflection
> Reflect on what you learned during this assignment. How have you improved from Project 1? What would you do differently next time? (2-3 sentences)

From this project, I learned the importance of functional interactivity in user experience design. Compared to Project 1, I focused more on integrating feedback loops and ensuring the interface feels both responsive and intuitive. Next time, I would dedicate more time to prototyping and user testing to identify potential usability improvements earlier.


> Take some time here to reflect on how much you've learned since you started this class. It's often easy to ignore our own progress. Take a moment and think about your accomplishments in this class. Hopefully you'll recognize that you've accomplished a lot and that you should be very proud of those accomplishments! (1-3 sentences)

Since starting this class, I've learned foundational skills in HTML and CSS and advanced to understanding JavaScript and CSS flexbox. Mastering these tools has made me more confident in creating dynamic, responsive layouts and designing interactive elements that enhance user experience. I'm proud of the progress I've made and excited to keep building on these skills.
